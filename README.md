Repo for my teentech project. 
MQ135 takes readings of the indoor air quality in ppm, and the flask server displays the ppm, and the saftey level of the air.

Guide for the files: 
ADUINO_WITH_MQ135.ino: \This is the code for the arduino. It runs on the arduino(pro micro) and gives us a ppm reading.
